# Look and say kata

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence>

Easy game, look at a number and prononce what you see.

- 1 -> I see one 1 -> I see 1 1 -> 11
- 11 -> I see two 1 -> I see 2 1 -> 21
- 1223 -> I see one 1 two 2 one 3 -> I see 1 1 2 1 1 3 -> 112113

You got it ?

TDD is way too powerful, I refactored my code like 20 times and I was so confident.
